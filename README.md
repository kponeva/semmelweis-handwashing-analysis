# semmelweis_handwashing_theory
In this mini-project, I aimed to practice skills in applying Pandas Dataframe, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statistics, and Boostrap Analysis to solve the medical mystery which was initially solved by a man who first discovered the importance of handwashing, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis. This will be another living proof that unwashed hands could kill many lives. Therefore, please wash your filthy hands before doing anything.
